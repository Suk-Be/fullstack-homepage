Webdevelopment/SOK DESIGN/01.07.2024-Visitenkarte.bmpr

I implemented a custom hook to setLogin
for this i used ReactTanStack 5 
with get logic snippet from documentation
but it actually posts login
so the snippet does not fit to well

Now it refetches Login th user data in a loop?

- Maybe i should just fetch the old way in a useEffect hook just once
- reading the docs might help (post)
